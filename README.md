# Monty Hall problem 
[The Monty Hall problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) originates from an American game show called 'Let's Make a Deal'. The problem goes as follows:

> Suppose you have 3 doors. Behind one of the doors is a car, behind the others there is a goat. You select one of the doors to take what is behind it, after which one of the remaining doors containing a goat is opened. You are asked whether you want to switch to a different door. Should you switch?

The Monty Hall problem is a statistical problem that has an unintuitive answer, as posed by Marilyn vos Savant. Switching to a different door, counterintuitively increases your chances of winning the car. 

This is a script that simulates the Monty Hall problem using Python to get a practical result. 

## Run the script
To run the script, you will have to clone this repository and run the `client.py` script using Python. This can be done using the following command:

    python3 client.py
